I dream in black and white
No colour for tonight
My shadow dancer
My shadow dancer
My shadow dancer
I see both night and day
Looking down from where I am
Fellow traveller
Got no one to answer
Got no one to answer
And it's close to gettin' wrong
It's touch and go
Close to disaster
Where it's always twilight
I dream in black and white
No colour for tonight
My shadow dancer
My shadow dancer
My shadow dancer
I see both night and day
Looking down from where I am
Fellow traveller
Got no one to answer
Got no one to answer
And it's close to gettin' wrong
It's touch and go
Close to disaster
Where it's always twilight
I dream in black and white
No colour for tonight
My shadow dancer
In my sleepy satellite
Got no one to answer
Got no one to answer
I see both night and day
Looking down from where I am
Fellow traveller
Fellow traveller
And it's close to gettin' wrong
It's touch and go
Close to disaster
Where it's always twilight
Where it's always twilight
Always twilight
Where it's always twilight
It's always twilight
Always twilight
Where it's always twilight
