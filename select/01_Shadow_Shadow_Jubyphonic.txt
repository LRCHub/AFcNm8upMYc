I'm crying in the dark over your brutal, beating lie
I don't know who to blame, I didn't know that I was blind
For doubt I'll pay the price, the mirrored bodies moving slow
I'm all alone, shadow shadow

Sell your soul now to the devil on the corner of the street
And if it isn't eaten, then it's null and void you see
Though lovely as they smile, kill them quickly breaking bone
I'm all alone, shadow shadow

Glinted tiptoes in the darkness
Can I say that this is hell?
Your head begins to wander
No don't worry, you're not ill
Determined now to lie, I feel a chill I didn't know
I'm all alone, shadow shadow

Not enough, a love that's cruel and rough
The sweetened smoke above
The night is young, hunting hell hyenas run amok
A saint without a robe
Now naked and alone
A face I'll never know

Order
The ego fights in turn
Destroy the child, burn
The pain I feel grows into this pleasure when it hurts
Hey, can you hear the screams?
The ballad that is dancing forsaken shadow signs

Sell your soul now to the devil on the corner of the street
And if it isn't eaten, then it's null and void you see
Though lovely as they smile, kill them quickly breaking bone
I'm all alone, shadow shadow

Glinted tiptoes in the darkness
Can I say that this is hell?
Your head begins to wander
No don't worry, you're not ill
Determined now to lie, I feel a chill I didn't know
I'm all alone, shadow shadow

Look inside it with a sigh and see the skinned and feeble form
With ashes in a pile, hide the hollowness adorned
My hand is dyed with lead
Pain I've deeply come to know
I'm all alone, shadow shadow
